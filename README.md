#  Code Quiz

## Description


I have been tasked with creating a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:
* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

## Technologies Used
This project was created using 
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS


## Screenshot
Once deployed you can see the web application in your browser. It should look like the screen shot attached
